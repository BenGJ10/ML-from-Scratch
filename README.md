# ML Models from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `Datasets/` - Contains datasets used for training and testing models.
- `Linear Regression.ipynb` - Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch.
- `README.md` - Documentation of the repository.

## ðŸ“Œ Implemented Models

- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression (Coming soon)
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (Coming soon)
